; Define what variables should be unlocalized for lua environment, making them global to the script namespace
; In brackets you define the script file name as a section, without ".script" part
; Under the section put all variables that should be unlocalized, just their names
; Below is the example for actor_effects.script file. RENDERER and STATIC_LIGHT variables are local there, and this file will make them global
; all unlocalizers .ltx files should be put into gamedata/configs/unlocalizers folder
; unlocalizer .ltx'es can be named as you wish, there are no rules there

; Supported local definitions (if local is declared like in the list below, it is possible to unlocalize it)
;	local <name> = <value> (will be transformed to <name> = <value>)
;	local <name> (will be transformed to <name> = nil)
;	local <name1>,<name2>,<name3> (if any of name1, name2, name3 is in unlocalizers' lists, they all will be unlocalized) (will be transformed to <name1>,<name2>,<name3> = nil)
;	local <name1>,<name2>,<name3> = <value1>,<value2>... (will be transformed to <name1>,<name2>,<name3> = <value1>,<value2>...)
;	local function <function_name>... (will be transformed to function <function_name>...)

; Unsupported local definitions
;	local x; local y (will be ignored)
;	local x local y (will be ignored)
;	any variations of multiple local keywords on a single line (will be ignored)
